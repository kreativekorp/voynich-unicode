# Voynich Unicode

The Voynich Unicode font package consists of several fonts which encode
characters from the Voynich Manuscript. The characters included are a
superset of Gabriel Landini's EVA (Extensible Voynich Alphabet) and
Glenn Claston's V101 (Voynich 101) encodings.

There are five fonts included in the package:

  * Voynich Unicode encodes a superset of the EVA and V101 characters at U+FF400 - U+FF51F.
  * Voynich EVA additionally encodes the EVA characters at U+0020 - U+00FF and U+F020 - U+F0FF.
  * Voynich V101 additionally encodes the V101 characters at U+0020 - U+00FF and U+F020 - U+F0FF.
  * Fairfax EVA HD is a special build of Fairfax HD with the same encoding as Voynich EVA.
